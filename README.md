# AI-Powered-Basketball-Player-Tracking
for someone who already has a functioning program that can over basketball games, automatically, to grab necessary statistics from the game.

If you look at the video here, it needs to work like this, it doesn’t have to be as detailed as this - we don’t need to know what player did what, it would only need to know the team level and what the team did.

We believe someone already has this program working effectively, and we have videos we want to run it over to get statistics. You can even recommend a place or person that we can achieve this with.

The important key is that it’s accurate and allows us to gain the insights we need.
--------------
Developing or sourcing a program to extract basketball statistics from game videos is a complex task that typically combines computer vision, video analysis, and domain-specific heuristics. Below is an approach for creating or identifying such a program, along with Python-based suggestions for implementing it if you'd like to build one:
Approach to Build a Basketball Game Stats Extraction Tool
Step 1: Define Required Stats

Since you're focusing on team-level stats, identify metrics such as:

    Points scored
    Rebounds
    Assists
    Turnovers
    Fouls
    Shot attempts (2-point, 3-point, free throws)

Step 2: Video Processing Framework

Use video analysis frameworks to process basketball game footage:

    Tools: OpenCV for frame processing, TensorFlow or PyTorch for AI models, and Mediapipe for pose/keypoint detection.
    Pre-trained Models: Utilize pre-trained sports-specific action recognition models.

Step 3: Data Sources

Integrate play-by-play datasets or labeled videos for training and testing the model.
Step 4: Model for Team Activity Detection

Leverage object detection models (e.g., YOLO or Detectron2) to identify:

    Ball location
    Court layout (lines, boundaries)
    Team uniforms/colors for team identification

Step 5: Statistics Aggregation

Design logic to infer stats based on detected events:

    Count possessions, shot attempts, and made baskets based on ball trajectory.
    Infer fouls and turnovers using motion patterns and stoppages.

Python Code Outline

Below is a simplified outline of how such a program might be structured. Note that creating a production-grade tool requires additional effort for accuracy and efficiency.

import cv2
import numpy as np
from yolov5 import YOLOv5
from basketball_court import CourtLayout

# Initialize YOLOv5 for object detection (players, ball)
model = YOLOv5("yolov5_model_path")

# Load basketball court layout
court_layout = CourtLayout("court_template.jpg")

def process_video(video_path):
    cap = cv2.VideoCapture(video_path)
    frame_rate = int(cap.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FPS))
    frame_count = int(cap.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_COUNT))

    # Stats dictionary
    stats = {
        "team_a_points": 0,
        "team_b_points": 0,
        "shot_attempts": {"team_a": 0, "team_b": 0},
        "rebounds": {"team_a": 0, "team_b": 0},
        "turnovers": {"team_a": 0, "team_b": 0},
    }

    while cap.isOpened():
        ret, frame = cap.read()
        if not ret:
            break

        # Detect players and ball
        results = model.predict(frame)
        players = results.get("players", [])
        ball = results.get("ball", None)

        # Court recognition and positioning
        frame = court_layout.annotate_court(frame, players, ball)

        # Extract stats based on detected positions
        if ball:
            # Check shot or rebound
            process_ball_movement(ball, stats)

        # Additional logic for turnovers, fouls, etc.
        # ...

        cv2.imshow("Processed Frame", frame)
        if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
            break

    cap.release()
    cv2.destroyAllWindows()

    print("Game Stats:", stats)

def process_ball_movement(ball, stats):
    # Logic to track ball trajectory and determine if a shot was made
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    video_path = "basketball_game.mp4"
    process_video(video_path)
